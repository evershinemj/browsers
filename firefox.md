# how to simulate mobile phone user agent:
for windows:
press **Ctrl+Shift+M**(*mnemonic*: M for mobile phone)
for mac:
press **cmd+option+M**
After this, a **settings icon** appears on top right corner. Click and select `reload when user agent is changed`

# history
ctrl+h(windows)/cmd+shift+h(mac)(not cmd+h, which is reserved for hiding, as in other applications)

# manage bookmarks
ctrl+shift+b/cmd+shift+b

# show addons
cmd+shift+a

# stop
cmd+.(just like `esc`)

# toggle bookmarks
> ctrl+b

# toggle history
> ctrl+h

# url completion
## on windows
**tab** works for **url completion** in firefox
## on mac
**ctrl-n** and **ctrl-p** work great in firefox

# developer mode
## tabs
### inspector(DOM explorer)
note that this tab is used for easy navigation of the DOM tree, rather than viewing the overall html source.
### console
### debugger
firefox debugger uses a tag icon to signify a breakpoint.
## view source
ctrl-u
