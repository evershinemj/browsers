# how to simulate mobile phone user agent:
for windows:
press **Ctrl+Shift+M**(*mnemonic*: M for mobile phone)
for mac:
press **cmd+option+M**
After this, a **settings icon** appears on top right corner. Click and select `reload when user agent is changed`

ctrl+h(windows)/cmd+shift+h(mac)(not cmd+h, which is reserved for hiding, as in other applications)

ctrl+shift+b/cmd+shift+b

cmd+shift+a

cmd+.(just like `esc`)
